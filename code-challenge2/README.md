# React + Vite

This is a simple React app that helps you create and track your financial savings goals. You can add new goals, deposit money into them, see your progress, and delete goals you don’t want anymore.

What can you do?
Add a new goal — like “Vacation Fund” or “Emergency Savings.”

Deposit money to any goal to track how much you’ve saved.

See your progress for each goal: how much saved, how much left, and if you’re on track.

Delete goals if you finish or change your plans.

Overview: get a quick summary of all your goals.
